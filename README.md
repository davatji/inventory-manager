1. How do I implement each task? 
a) I created a new Django project by creating an empty local directory and initializing it as a repository. I created a virtual environment using "python -m venv env" command to isolate the project. Then, I installed all the file requirements. I continued by creating a new project with command: "django-admin startproject "project_name" .", which yields a new project folder inside the main folder. I set the allowed host to be for everyone.
b) I created a new application, which is a modular unit inside the project, through manage.py using command "python manage.py startapp main". this yields a new folder named main that contains all the python files needed to run the application. Then, I included the newly made application to the project by adding "main" to list of INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py
c) I configured the project URL routing by defining a new element in url_patterns list, adding path('main/', include('main.urls')), so that whenever there is a main/ suffix in the URL, the access request is directed to the main application, where main.urls.py is located. 
d) I created a model for the main application by modifying model.py in the main application folder and defining a model class named Item that inherits models. The model has a name, amount, and description field with the appropriate data type. This model will function as a data/information holder structure behind the application that links to the database
e) In my views.py, I created a handler function, show_main, which will be called whenever there is an access request for the main app url. the function will build up the context, which might contain database retrieval in the future, and the context will be passed as one of the parameters along with the main.html that is contained in the templates folder. the context is in a form of dictionary and the key will be matched with the html file and thus the value will replace some text in html file. 
f) I created a routing in urls.py in main application folder and configured it so that whenever it is accessed, the show_main method is called.
g) Last, I deployed the project to the internet by connecting my cloud repository in Github to Adaptable.io
